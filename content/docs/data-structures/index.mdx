description: Master fundamental and advanced data structures with hands-on learning.
---

This site includes comprehensive learning paths for core data structures, from basics to advanced, with explanations, examples, and practice problems.

## Topics
It comes with the following topics out of the box:

- Arrays and techniques like prefix sum and sliding window.
- Linked Lists including singly, doubly, and cycle detection.
- Stacks with applications like expression conversion and next greater element.
- Queues including circular queues, deques, and priority queues.
- Hashing using hash maps, sets, and collision resolution methods.
- Trees including binary trees, BSTs, traversals, AVL trees, and tries.
- Heaps for priority queues, heap sort, and min/max heap implementation.
- Graphs with BFS, DFS, topological sort, and cycle detection.
- Advanced structures like segment trees, Fenwick trees, and disjoint sets (coming soon).
