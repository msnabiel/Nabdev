---

Linked lists are a dynamic data structure used when the number of elements is unknown or frequently changing. Let’s explore how they work, how to implement them, and the powerful techniques and problems associated.

## 1. Basics & Structure

A linked list node contains data and a pointer to the next node.

```cpp
struct Node {
    int data;
    Node* next;

    Node(int val) {
        data = val;
        next = nullptr;
    }
};
```

## 2. Insertion & Traversal

### Insert at head
Inserts a new node with the given value at the beginning of the linked list.
```cpp
Node* insertAtHead(Node* head, int val) {
    Node* newNode = new Node(val);  // Create a new node with the given value
    newNode->next = head;           // Set the new node's next to the current head
    return newNode;                 // Return the new node as the new head
}
```
### Insert at tail
Inserts a new node with the given value at the end of the linked list.
```cpp
Node* insertAtTail(Node* head, int val) {
    Node* newNode = new Node(val);  // Create a new node with the given value
    if (!head) return newNode;      // If the list is empty, return the new node as the head

    Node* temp = head;              // Start at the head
    while (temp->next) temp = temp->next;  // Traverse to the last node
    temp->next = newNode;           // Link the last node to the new node
    return head;                    // Return the unchanged head of the list
}
```
### Traverse
Traverses the entire linked list and prints the data of each node.
```cpp
void printList(Node* head) {
    while (head) {               // While there are more nodes
        cout << head->data << " "; // Print the data of the current node
        head = head->next;         // Move to the next node
    }
    cout << "\n";                 // Print a newline after the list is printed
}

```
## 3. Reverse a Linked List
Reverses the order of nodes in the linked list, making the last node the head and the first node the tail.
```cpp
Node* reverseList(Node* head) {
    Node* prev = nullptr;        // Previous node starts as nullptr (the new tail will point to nullptr)
    Node* current = head;        // Start with the head of the list
    Node* next = nullptr;        // Temporary pointer to store the next node during traversal

    while (current) {            // Traverse through the list until reaching the end
        next = current->next;    // Store the next node
        current->next = prev;    // Reverse the current node's pointer to point to the previous node
        prev = current;          // Move the prev pointer to the current node
        current = next;          // Move to the next node in the original list
    }

    return prev;                 // At the end, prev will be the new head of the reversed list
}
```
## 4. Find Middle Node (Fast & Slow Pointers)
Finds the middle node of the linked list in a single pass by using two pointers: a fast pointer that moves two steps at a time and a slow pointer that moves one step at a time.
```cpp
Node* findMiddle(Node* head) {
    if (!head) return nullptr;    // If the list is empty, return nullptr

    Node* slow = head;            // Slow pointer starts at the head
    Node* fast = head;            // Fast pointer also starts at the head

    while (fast && fast->next) {  // Traverse the list while fast and fast->next are not null
        slow = slow->next;        // Move slow pointer by one step
        fast = fast->next->next;  // Move fast pointer by two steps
    }

    return slow;                  // When fast reaches the end, slow will be at the middle
}
```
**Explanation**
- **Slow pointer**: Moves one step at a time and will be at the middle when the fast pointer reaches the end of the list.
- **Fast pointer**: Moves two steps at a time and helps determine when the end of the list is reached.
- The loop continues as long as the fast pointer and the fast pointer’s next node are valid. Once the fast pointer reaches the end, the slow pointer will be at the middle of the list.
- This method runs in **O(n)** time and uses **O(1)** extra space, making it an efficient way to find the middle node of a linked list.
## 5. Detect Cycle (Floyd’s Algorithm)
Detects if there is a cycle in a linked list using two pointers moving at different speeds (slow and fast). If there is a cycle, the slow and fast pointers will eventually meet.
```cpp
bool hasCycle(Node* head) {
    if (!head || !head->next) return false;  // If the list is empty or has only one node, no cycle

    Node* slow = head;          // Slow pointer starts at head
    Node* fast = head;          // Fast pointer starts at head

    while (fast && fast->next) {  // Traverse the list as long as fast can move two steps
        slow = slow->next;        // Move slow pointer by one step
        fast = fast->next->next;  // Move fast pointer by two steps

        if (slow == fast) {       // If slow and fast pointers meet, there's a cycle
            return true;
        }
    }

    return false;  // If the loop ends without slow and fast meeting, there's no cycle
}
```
**Explanation**
- **Slow pointer**: Moves one step at a time.
- **Fast pointer**: Moves two steps at a time.
- If the two pointers meet at some point, there’s a cycle in the list. If the fast pointer reaches the end, there’s no cycle.
- This algorithm runs in **O(n)** time and **O(1)** space.
## 6. Merge Two Sorted Lists
Merges two sorted linked lists into one sorted linked list.
```cpp
Node* mergeLists(Node* l1, Node* l2) {
    Node* dummy = new Node(0);  // Create a dummy node to help with merging
    Node* current = dummy;      // Pointer to the last node in the merged list

    while (l1 && l2) {          // Traverse both lists while they are not empty
        if (l1->data < l2->data) {   // If l1’s value is smaller, add l1 to the merged list
            current->next = l1;
            l1 = l1->next;
        } else {                  // If l2’s value is smaller or equal, add l2 to the merged list
            current->next = l2;
            l2 = l2->next;
        }
        current = current->next; // Move the current pointer to the last node
    }

    // Append the remaining nodes of the non-empty list (if any)
    if (l1) current->next = l1;
    if (l2) current->next = l2;

    return dummy->next;  // Return the merged list starting from the first actual node
}
```
**Explanation**
- **Dummy node**: A temporary node that simplifies the merging process by serving as the starting point.
- The function compares nodes from both lists and appends the smaller node to the merged list, ensuring the result is sorted.
- Runs in O(n + m) time, where n and m are the lengths of the two lists.
## 7. Check Palindrome
Checks if the linked list is a palindrome (reads the same forward and backward).
```cpp
bool isPalindrome(Node* head) {
    if (!head || !head->next) return true;  // A list with 0 or 1 node is always a palindrome

    // Step 1: Find the middle of the list using slow and fast pointers
    Node* slow = head;
    Node* fast = head;

    while (fast && fast->next) {
        slow = slow->next;
        fast = fast->next->next;
    }

    // Step 2: Reverse the second half of the list
    Node* prev = nullptr;
    Node* curr = slow;
    while (curr) {
        Node* nextNode = curr->next;
        curr->next = prev;
        prev = curr;
        curr = nextNode;
    }

    // Step 3: Compare the first and second halves
    Node* firstHalf = head;
    Node* secondHalf = prev;  // Second half starts at the reversed portion

    while (secondHalf) {
        if (firstHalf->data != secondHalf->data) {
            return false;  // If any data doesn’t match, it's not a palindrome
        }
        firstHalf = firstHalf->next;
        secondHalf = secondHalf->next;
    }

    return true;  // If all nodes matched, it's a palindrome
}
```
**Explanation**
- **Slow and fast pointers**: Used to find the middle of the list.
- **Reverse the second half**: After finding the middle, reverse the second half of the list.
- **Comparison**: Compare the first half and the reversed second half of the list.
- Runs in **O(n)** time and uses **O(1)** space.
## 8. Delete N-th Node from End
Deletes the N-th node from the end of the linked list in a single pass.
```cpp
Node* deleteNthFromEnd(Node* head, int n) {
    Node* dummy = new Node(0);  // Create a dummy node to handle edge cases (e.g., removing the head)
    dummy->next = head;

    Node* first = dummy;         // Start first pointer at dummy node
    Node* second = dummy;        // Start second pointer at dummy node

    // Move first pointer n+1 steps ahead
    for (int i = 0; i <= n; i++) {
        first = first->next;
    }

    // Move both first and second pointers until first reaches the end
    while (first) {
        first = first->next;
        second = second->next;
    }

    // Now second is at the node just before the one to delete
    Node* toDelete = second->next;
    second->next = second->next->next;  // Skip the node to delete

    delete toDelete;  // Free the memory of the deleted node

    return dummy->next;  // Return the updated list
}
```
**Explanation**
- **Dummy node**: Simplifies edge cases, such as deleting the head node.
- **Two pointers**: The first pointer is moved n+1 steps ahead, and then both pointers are moved together until the first pointer reaches the end. The second pointer will be just before the node to delete.
- Runs in **O(n)** time and **O(1)** space.
## 9. Extensions

### Doubly Linked Lists
- Nodes contain `prev` and `next` pointers.
- Allows bi-directional traversal.
- Easier to delete a node when you have a pointer to it.
- Used in: LRU Cache, Undo/Redo functionality, Browsing History.

```cpp
struct Node {
    int data;
    Node* prev;
    Node* next;
};
```

### Linked List + Stack/Queue Hybrids
Stack (LIFO) using Linked List:
- Insert/delete at head
- O(1) push and pop
```cpp
void push(int val) {
    Node* node = new Node(val);
    node->next = head;
    head = node;
}
```
Queue (FIFO) using Linked List:
- Maintain head and tail pointers
- Enqueue at tail, dequeue at head
```cpp
void enqueue(int val) {
    Node* node = new Node(val);
    if (tail) tail->next = node;
    else head = node;
    tail = node;
}
```
### Circular Linked Lists
A **Circular Linked List** is a variation of a linked list where the last node points back to the head. This makes traversing circular and avoids the need for a `nullptr` check at the end.
#### Node Structure
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

struct Node {
    int data;
    Node* next;
    Node(int val) : data(val), next(nullptr) {}
};
```
Each node stores an integer data and a pointer to the next node. The constructor initializes data and sets next to nullptr.
#### Insert Operation
```cpp
Node* insert(Node* head, int val) {
    Node* newNode = new Node(val);
    if (!head) {
        newNode->next = newNode; // point to itself
        return newNode;
    }

    Node* temp = head;
    while (temp->next != head)
        temp = temp->next;

    temp->next = newNode;
    newNode->next = head;
    return head;
}
```
**Explanation:**
- If the list is empty, the new node points to itself and becomes the head.
- Otherwise, traverse to the last node (which points to head) and link the new node at the end, maintaining circularity.
#### Delete Operation
```cpp
Node* deleteNode(Node* head, int val) {
    if (!head) return nullptr;

    // Case: Only one node and it matches
    if (head->next == head && head->data == val) {
        delete head;
        return nullptr;
    }

    Node* curr = head;
    Node* prev = nullptr;

    // Case: Deleting head node
    if (head->data == val) {
        // Find the last node
        prev = head;
        while (prev->next != head)
            prev = prev->next;

        prev->next = head->next;
        Node* newHead = head->next;
        delete head;
        return newHead;
    }

    // Case: Deleting non-head node
    prev = head;
    curr = head->next;
    while (curr != head) {
        if (curr->data == val) {
            prev->next = curr->next;
            delete curr;
            return head;
        }
        prev = curr;
        curr = curr->next;
    }

    // Node not found
    return head;
}
```
**Explanation:**
- Handles deletion of the only node, the head node, or any non-head node.
- If node not found, the list remains unchanged.
#### Display Operation
```cpp
void display(Node* head) {
    if (!head) {
        cout << "List is empty\n";
        return;
    }

    Node* temp = head;
    do {
        cout << temp->data << " ";
        temp = temp->next;
    } while (temp != head);

    cout << endl;
}
```
**Explanation:**
- Prints all values in the circular list using a do-while loop to ensure it starts and ends at head.
## 10. Practice Problems and Examples

### Reverse a Doubly Linked List
Reverses the direction of a doubly linked list by swapping `next` and `prev` pointers of each node.
```cpp
Node* reverseDLL(Node* head) {
    Node* curr = head;
    Node* temp = nullptr;

    while (curr) {
        temp = curr->prev;
        curr->prev = curr->next;
        curr->next = temp;
        curr = curr->prev;
    }

    return temp ? temp->prev : nullptr;
}
```
**Use Case:** Reversing history in a browser or editor.
### Check if Circular Linked List
Checks whether a linked list is circular by traversing the list and seeing if it loops back to the head.
```cpp
bool isCircular(Node* head) {
    if (!head) return true;

    Node* temp = head->next;
    while (temp && temp != head)
        temp = temp->next;

    return temp == head;
}
```
**Use Case:** Validate if list is circular (round-robin structures).
### Implement LRU Cache (Doubly Linked List + HashMap)
Combines a doubly linked list and a hashmap to implement an efficient Least Recently Used cache with O(1) access and update.
```cpp
class LRUCache {
    int cap;
    list<pair<int, int>> dll;
    unordered_map<int, list<pair<int, int>>::iterator> mp;

public:
    LRUCache(int capacity) : cap(capacity) {}

    int get(int key) {
        if (mp.find(key) == mp.end()) return -1;
        dll.splice(dll.begin(), dll, mp[key]);
        return mp[key]->second;
    }

    void put(int key, int value) {
        if (mp.find(key) != mp.end()) {
            dll.splice(dll.begin(), dll, mp[key]);
            mp[key]->second = value;
            return;
        }
        if (dll.size() == cap) {
            mp.erase(dll.back().first);
            dll.pop_back();
        }
        dll.emplace_front(key, value);
        mp[key] = dll.begin();
    }
};
```
**Use Case:** Memory/cache management where most recently used is retained.
### Stack using Linked List (LIFO)
Implements a stack using a singly linked list where elements are added and removed from the top.
```cpp
struct Stack {
    Node* top = nullptr;

    void push(int x) {
        Node* temp = new Node(x);
        temp->next = top;
        top = temp;
    }

    int pop() {
        if (!top) return -1;
        int val = top->data;
        Node* temp = top;
        top = top->next;
        delete temp;
        return val;
    }
};
```
**Use Case:** Undo operation, recursion emulation.
### Queue using Linked List (FIFO)
Implements a queue using a linked list with pointers to the front and rear for enqueue and dequeue operations.
```cpp
struct Queue {
    Node *front = nullptr, *rear = nullptr;

    void enqueue(int x) {
        Node* temp = new Node(x);
        if (!rear) {
            front = rear = temp;
            return;
        }
        rear->next = temp;
        rear = temp;
    }

    int dequeue() {
        if (!front) return -1;
        int val = front->data;
        Node* temp = front;
        front = front->next;
        if (!front) rear = nullptr;
        delete temp;
        return val;
    }
};
```
**Use Case**: Job scheduling, order processing, or handling asynchronous data.<br />
These variants help solve problems requiring constant-time insertion/deletion at both ends or cyclic behavior.
