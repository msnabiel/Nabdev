Dynamic Programming (DP) is a powerful problem-solving technique that breaks down complex problems into simpler overlapping subproblems and stores their solutions to avoid redundant calculations. Let's explore the core concepts, common patterns, and real-world applications of DP.

## 1. Core Concepts

Dynamic Programming works by following these key principles:

### Optimal Substructure
A problem has optimal substructure if an optimal solution can be constructed from optimal solutions of its subproblems.

### Overlapping Subproblems
The same subproblems are solved multiple times when a recursive solution is applied.

### Memoization vs. Tabulation
- **Memoization (Top-Down)**: Recursive approach with results stored in a memo table
- **Tabulation (Bottom-Up)**: Iterative approach building up solutions from the smallest subproblems

## 2. Fibonacci Sequence: A Classic Example

The Fibonacci sequence is a perfect introduction to dynamic programming.

### Naive Recursive Approach (Exponential Time)
```cpp
int fibonacci(int n) {
    if (n <= 1) return n;
    return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2);
}
```

### Top-Down with Memoization (Linear Time)
```cpp
int fibonacciMemo(int n, vector<int>& memo) {
    if (n <= 1) return n;

    // If we've already computed this value, return it
    if (memo[n] != -1) return memo[n];

    // Compute and store the result
    memo[n] = fibonacciMemo(n-1, memo) + fibonacciMemo(n-2, memo);
    return memo[n];
}

int fibonacci(int n) {
    vector<int> memo(n+1, -1);
    return fibonacciMemo(n, memo);
}
```

### Bottom-Up with Tabulation (Linear Time)
```cpp
int fibonacci(int n) {
    if (n <= 1) return n;

    vector<int> dp(n+1);
    dp[0] = 0;
    dp[1] = 1;

    for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
        dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2];
    }

    return dp[n];
}
```

### Space-Optimized Version (Constant Space)
```cpp
int fibonacci(int n) {
    if (n <= 1) return n;

    int prev = 0;
    int curr = 1;

    for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
        int next = prev + curr;
        prev = curr;
        curr = next;
    }

    return curr;
}
```

## 3. Common Dynamic Programming Patterns

### 1. Linear Sequence DP

Problems where the state depends on the previous elements in a sequence.

**Example: Maximum Subarray Sum (Kadane's Algorithm)**

Find the contiguous subarray with the largest sum.

```cpp
int maxSubarraySum(vector<int>& nums) {
    int currentMax = nums[0];
    int globalMax = nums[0];

    for (int i = 1; i < nums.size(); i++) {
        // Either extend the previous subarray or start a new one
        currentMax = max(nums[i], currentMax + nums[i]);
        globalMax = max(globalMax, currentMax);
    }

    return globalMax;
}
```

### 2. Grid-Based DP

Problems involving traversal or computation on a 2D grid.

**Example: Minimum Path Sum**

Find the path with the minimum sum from top-left to bottom-right in a grid.

```cpp
int minPathSum(vector<vector<int>>& grid) {
    int m = grid.size();
    int n = grid[0].size();

    // Initialize dp table
    vector<vector<int>> dp(m, vector<int>(n));
    dp[0][0] = grid[0][0];

    // Fill first row
    for (int j = 1; j < n; j++)
        dp[0][j] = dp[0][j-1] + grid[0][j];

    // Fill first column
    for (int i = 1; i < m; i++)
        dp[i][0] = dp[i-1][0] + grid[i][0];

    // Fill rest of the dp table
    for (int i = 1; i < m; i++) {
        for (int j = 1; j < n; j++) {
            dp[i][j] = grid[i][j] + min(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1]);
        }
    }

    return dp[m-1][n-1];
}
```

### 3. String DP Problems

Problems involving string operations, matching, or transformations.

**Example: Longest Common Subsequence**

Find the length of the longest subsequence common to two strings.

```cpp
int longestCommonSubsequence(string text1, string text2) {
    int m = text1.length();
    int n = text2.length();

    // Create a DP table
    vector<vector<int>> dp(m+1, vector<int>(n+1, 0));

    for (int i = 1; i <= m; i++) {
        for (int j = 1; j <= n; j++) {
            if (text1[i-1] == text2[j-1])
                dp[i][j] = 1 + dp[i-1][j-1];
            else
                dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1]);
        }
    }

    return dp[m][n];
}
```

### 4. Decision Making DP

Problems involving decisions that affect future states and outcomes.

**Example: House Robber**

Determine the maximum amount of money that can be robbed without alerting the police (can't rob adjacent houses).

```cpp
int rob(vector<int>& nums) {
    int n = nums.size();
    if (n == 0) return 0;
    if (n == 1) return nums[0];

    vector<int> dp(n);
    dp[0] = nums[0];
    dp[1] = max(nums[0], nums[1]);

    for (int i = 2; i < n; i++) {
        // Either rob current house and skip previous one, or skip current house
        dp[i] = max(dp[i-2] + nums[i], dp[i-1]);
    }

    return dp[n-1];
}
```

### 5. Knapsack-Type Problems

Problems involving selection from a set of items with constraints.

**Example: 0/1 Knapsack Problem**

Select items with weights and values to maximize value while staying within a weight limit.

```cpp
int knapsack(vector<int>& weights, vector<int>& values, int capacity) {
    int n = weights.size();
    vector<vector<int>> dp(n+1, vector<int>(capacity+1, 0));

    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        for (int w = 1; w <= capacity; w++) {
            // If current item can fit
            if (weights[i-1] <= w)
                // Max of: including current item or excluding it
                dp[i][w] = max(values[i-1] + dp[i-1][w-weights[i-1]], dp[i-1][w]);
            else
                // Can't include current item
                dp[i][w] = dp[i-1][w];
        }
    }

    return dp[n][capacity];
}
```

## 4. Real-World Applications

Dynamic Programming is used in many practical applications:

### 1. Shortest Path Algorithms
The Floyd-Warshall algorithm uses DP to find the shortest paths between all pairs of vertices in a weighted graph.

```cpp
void floydWarshall(vector<vector<int>>& graph, int V) {
    vector<vector<int>> dist = graph;

    // Consider each vertex as an intermediate
    for (int k = 0; k < V; k++) {
        // Pick all vertices as source
        for (int i = 0; i < V; i++) {
            // Pick all vertices as destination
            for (int j = 0; j < V; j++) {
                // If vertex k is on the shortest path from i to j,
                // update the value of dist[i][j]
                if (dist[i][k] != INF && dist[k][j] != INF &&
                    dist[i][k] + dist[k][j] < dist[i][j])
                    dist[i][j] = dist[i][k] + dist[k][j];
            }
        }
    }

    // Print the shortest distance matrix
    printSolution(dist, V);
}
```

### 2. Resource Allocation
DP helps optimize resource allocation in systems with constrained resources.

### 3. Text Processing and Bioinformatics
Algorithms like sequence alignment in DNA/protein sequences use DP.

### 4. Financial Planning and Investment Strategies
Portfolio optimization uses DP to maximize returns while managing risk.

### 5. Speech Recognition
Hidden Markov Models with DP algorithms like Viterbi are used in speech recognition systems.

## 5. Advanced Techniques

### State Compression
When the state space is large, we can compress the state representation using bit manipulation.

**Example: Travelling Salesman Problem with Bitmasks**

```cpp
int tsp(vector<vector<int>>& dist, int mask, int pos, vector<vector<int>>& dp) {
    int n = dist.size();

    // If all cities have been visited
    if (mask == ((1 << n) - 1))
        return dist[pos][0];

    // If this state has been computed before
    if (dp[mask][pos] != -1)
        return dp[mask][pos];

    int ans = INT_MAX;

    // Try to go to an unvisited city
    for (int city = 0; city < n; city++) {
        if ((mask & (1 << city)) == 0) {
            int newAns = dist[pos][city] + tsp(dist, mask | (1 << city), city, dp);
            ans = min(ans, newAns);
        }
    }

    return dp[mask][pos] = ans;
}
```

### Divide and Conquer DP
Some problems can be solved more efficiently using a divide-and-conquer approach with DP.

### Multi-dimensional DP
Some problems require multiple dimensions to represent the state.

**Example: Coin Change 2 (Number of Ways)**

```cpp
int change(int amount, vector<int>& coins) {
    vector<int> dp(amount + 1, 0);
    dp[0] = 1;

    for (int coin : coins) {
        for (int i = coin; i <= amount; i++) {
            dp[i] += dp[i - coin];
        }
    }

    return dp[amount];
}
```

## 6. DP Problem-Solving Framework

When approaching a DP problem, follow these steps:

1. **Identify the problem state**
   - What information do we need to make a decision at each step?

2. **Define the recurrence relation**
   - How does the current state relate to previous states?

3. **Identify the base cases**
   - What are the simplest subproblems that we know the answers to?

4. **Decide on a DP approach**
   - Top-down (memoization) or bottom-up (tabulation)?

5. **Optimize if needed**
   - Can we reduce the space complexity?

## 7. Common DP Problem Patterns

### 1. Minimum/Maximum Path to Reach a Target
- Examples: Minimum Path Sum, Coin Change, Longest Increasing Subsequence

### 2. Distinct Ways to Reach a Target
- Examples: Climbing Stairs, Unique Paths, Coin Change 2

### 3. Merging Intervals
- Examples: Burst Balloons, Minimum Cost Tree From Leaf Values

### 4. Decision Making
- Examples: House Robber, Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock with Cooldown

### 5. String Matching and Transformation
- Examples: Edit Distance, Regular Expression Matching

## 8. Time and Space Complexity Analysis

The time complexity of a DP solution typically depends on:
- Number of states (size of the DP table)
- Work done per state

For example, in the Knapsack problem:
- Number of states: O(n * capacity)
- Work per state: O(1)
- Total time complexity: O(n * capacity)

Space complexity can often be optimized by:
- Using rolling arrays (keeping only the last few rows/columns)
- Using a single array when only the previous state matters
